A basic level with self-scripted movement of sprite as well as animation sequencing and sound effects.
Simply assign these scripts on top of a sprite thast has a RigidBody and Character Controller component attached to them.
For the Jump script to work make sure that on the sprite there is atleast one floor and ceiling check as these are used in the script in order to check its' surroundings.
